> The `v1.0.0` version of this library was released on Oct 21, 2022. There are a number of new features and breaking changes, especially regarding the query builder workflow. Refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for full information.

This is the official [EdgeDB](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb) client library
for JavaScript and TypeScript.

If you're just getting started with EdgeDB, we recommend going through the
[EdgeDB Quickstart](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/quickstart) first. This walks
you through the process of installing EdgeDB, creating a simple schema, and
writing some simple queries.

### Requirements

- Node.js 16+
  - We rely on global `fetch` being available, so you can bring your own
    polyfill and if you run Node 16, you'll need to run with the
    `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.
- For TypeScript users:
  - TypeScript 4.4+ is required
  - `yarn add @types/node --dev`

### Installation

```bash
npm install edgedb      # npm users
yarn add edgedb         # yarn users
```

> EdgeDB 2.x requires `v0.21.0` or later

## Packages

- `packages/driver`: The `edgedb` client library.
- `packages/generate`: The `@edgedb/generate` package. Implements code generators, including `edgeql-js` and `queries`.
- `packages/deno`: The directory where the auto-generated `deno.land/x/edgedb` package is generated into. Both the driver and codegen tools are generated into this module.
- `packages/edgeql-js`: A skeleton package that prints an informative error message when `npx edgeql-js` is executed without `edgedb` installed.

## Basic usage

> The examples below demonstrate only the most fundamental use cases for this
> library. **[Go to the complete documentation site. >](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/js/index)**

### Create a client

A _client_ is an instance of the `Client` class, which maintains a pool of
connections to your database and provides methods for executing queries.

_For TypeScript (and Node.js+ESM)_

```ts
import * as edgedb from "edgedb";

const client = edgedb.createClient();
```

_For Node.js (CommonJS)_

```js
const edgedb = require("edgedb");

const client = edgedb.createClient();
```

### Configuring the connection

The call to `edgedb.createClient()` doesn't require arguments, as the library
can determine how to connect to your database using the following mechanisms.

1. _For local development_: initialize a project with the `edgedb project init`
   command. As long as the file is within a project directory, `createClient`
   will be able to auto-discover the connection information of the project's
   associated instance. For more information on projects, follow the
   [Using projects](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/guides/projects) guide.

2. _In production_: configure the connection using **environment variables**.
   (This can also be used during local development if you prefer.) The easiest
   way is to set the `EDGEDB_DSN` variable; a DSN (also known as a "connection
   string") is a string of the form
   `edgedb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT/DATABASE`.

For advanced cases, see the
[DSN specification](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/reference/dsn) and
[Reference > Connection Parameters](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/reference/connection).

### Run a query

> The remainder of the documentation assumes you are using ES module (`import`)
> syntax.

```ts
import * as edgedb from "edgedb";

const client = edgedb.createClient();
await client.query("select 2 + 2"); // => [4]
```

Note that the result is an _array_. The `.query()` method always returns an
array, regardless of the result cardinality of your query. If your query
returns _zero or one elements_, use the `.querySingle()` instead.

```ts
// empty set, zero elements
await client.querySingle("select <str>{}"); // => null

// one element
await client.querySingle("select 2 + 2"); // => 4

// one element
await client.querySingle(
  `select Movie { title }
  filter .id = <uuid>'2eb3bc76-a014-45dc-af66-2e6e8cc23e7e';`
); // => { title: "Dune" }
```

## Generators

Install the `@edgedb/generate` package as a dev dependency to take advantage of EdgeDB's built-in code generators.

```bash
npm install @edgedb/generate  --save-dev      # npm users
yarn add @edgedb/generate --dev               # yarn users
```

Then run a generator with the following command:

```bash
$ npx @edgedb/generate <generator> [FLAGS]
```

The following `<generator>`s are currently supported:

- `queries`: Generate typed functions from `*.edgeql` files
- `edgeql-js`: Generate the query builder

### `queries`

Run the following command to generate a source file for each `*.edgeql` system in your project.

```bash
$ npx @edgedb/generate queries
```

Assume you have a file called `getUser.edgeql` in your project directory.

```
// getUser.edgeql
select User {
  name,
  email
}
filter .email = <str>$email;
```

This generator will generate a `getUser.query.ts` file alongside it that exports a function called `getUser`.

```
import {createClient} from "edgedb";
import {myQuery} from "./myQuery.query";

const client = createClient();

const user = await myQuery(client, {name: "Timmy"});
user; // {name: string; email: string}
```

The first argument is a `Client`, the second is the set of _parameters_. Both the parameters and the returned value are fully typed.

### `edgeql-js` (query builder)

The query builder lets you write queries in a code-first way. It automatically infers the return type of your queries.

To generate the query builder, install the `edgedb` package, initialize a project (if you haven't already), then run the following command:

```bash
$ npx @edgedb/generate edgeql-js
```

This will generate an EdgeQL query builder into the `./dbschema/edgeql-js`
directory, as defined relative to your project root.

For details on generating the query builder, refer to the [complete documentation](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/js/generation). Below is a simple `select` query as an example.

```ts
import { createClient } from "edgedb";
import e from "./dbschema/edgeql-js";

const client = createClient();
const query = e.select(e.Movie, (movie) => ({
  id: true,
  title: true,
  actors: { name: true },
  num_actors: e.count(movie.actors),
  filter_single: e.op(movie.title, "=", "Dune"),
}));

const result = await query.run(client);
result.actors[0].name; // => Timothee Chalamet
```

For details on using the query builder, refer to the full [query builder docs](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/js/querybuilder).
