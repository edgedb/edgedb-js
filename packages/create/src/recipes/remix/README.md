# Remix Integration Recipe for EdgeDB

This recipe provides a starting point for building a [Remix](https://remix.run/) application with EdgeDB as the database. It is based on the official Remix starter template.

We try to actively monitor and incorporate significant changes from the original "create-app" templates to ensure developers have access to the latest features and best practices. However, we might not cover every possible configuration or permutation due to the vast scope of possibilities.

âœ¨ Check out the [`@edgedb/create` package](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/blob/master/packages/create/README.md) for more information.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm create @edgedb
# or
yarn create @edgedb
# or
pnpm create @edgedb
# or
bun create @edgedb
```

After running the command, you will be prompted to provide a project name and choose the **"Remix"** template. You can also specify whether to use EdgeDB Auth, initialize a git repository, and install dependencies.

The tool will then create a new directory with the specified name and set up the project.

## Local Recipe Development

Install dependencies in the root directory:

```bash
$ yarn
```

Navigate into `packages/create`:

```bash
$ cd packages/create
```

Build @edgedb/create

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Run a local version:

```bash
$ yarn run create
```

Then choose the **"Remix"** template.
