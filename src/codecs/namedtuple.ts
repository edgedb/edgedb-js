  /* Generate a NamedTuple specialized for the given *names* sequence.
   *
   * We need to create a named tuple.  Unfortunately, contrary to
   * Python, we don't have a magic `__getattr__` method.  Using
   * JS Proxies is prohibitively slow.
   *
   * First, let's list the requirements: we want the named tuple
   * to be fast to create (a), fast to populate with data (b), fast to
   * access the fields' values (c), being able to refer to the tuple's
   * fields by both *indexes* and *names*.  In addition to that, we
   * also want to customize how named tuples are serialized into
   * JSON, and we should ensure that they are printed correctly when
   * introspected via console.log().
   *
   * We basically have two options: use an array (or a subclass of
   * an array) or use an object.  Using the latter is way slower
   * across all operations.  So we want to stick to arrays.
   *
   * Options to create a named tuple based on array type:
   *
   * 1. Create a regular array.  Set both indexes and named properties
   *    on it directly:
   *
   *       tup = new Array(N);
   *       tup[0] = val0;
   *       tup[field0] = val0;
   *       // etc.
   *
   *    This option works relatively well, but isn't ideal: we do
   *    2x more "assign" operations.  We also still need to customize
   *    toJSON() and [inspect] hooks.  Further assignment to the
   *    object may skew its hidden class which will be detrimental
   *    to the performance.
   *
   *    Still, this is a viable option, albeit, not ideal.
   *
   * 2. Create an Object and populate it with numeric and named fields,
   *    e.g.:
   *
   *       tup = {}
   *       tup[0] = val0;
   *       tup[field0] = val0;
   *       // etc.
   *
   *    It appears that as soon as a numeric property is assigned to
   *    an object, V8 thinks that it should be converted to an Array
   *    (or deoptimized, I'm not sure).  The performance of accessing
   *    fields degrades drastically.  Not an option, at least in
   *    NodeJS 10.
   *
   * 3. Create an array subclass dynamically via setting __proto__,
   *    regular prototype inheritance, or using Object.setPrototypeOf.
   *    Unfortunately, generated array subtypes are more than 10x
   *    slower than regular arrays (even created via (1)).  So this is
   *    a non-option.
   *
   * 4. Create an array subclass with all extra methods/getters via
   *    "eval()" or "new Function()".  While using "eval()" can be a
   *    bad sign, I believe that in this case it's well justified.
   *    The performance of generated array subtype is the same as
   *    of a regular Array.  We do 2x less assignments than with (1),
   *    *and* we can be flexible with extending the functionality
   *    of the generated subtype.
   *
   *    Essentially, for a named tuple `(a := 1, b := 'aaa')` the
   *    following array subtype will be generated:
   *
   *       class NameTuple extends BaseNamedTuple {
   *         toJSON() {
   *           return {"a": this[0], "b": this[1]};
   *         }
   *
   *         get ["a"]() { return this[0]; }
   *
   *         get ["b"]() { return this[1]; }
   *       }
   *
   *    V8 JIT has apparently no problem with optimizing the above
   *    generated class.
   *
   *    Lastly, as with any "eval()", we need to make sure that a user
   *    data cannot interfere with the code we evaluating.  In this
   *    case, a user data consists of names of the fields, that can
   *    be arbitrary (e.g. contain JS keywords or even code.)
   *    To mitigate that, we use `JSON.stringify()` to escape all
   *    field names we compile into the source code (see the above
   *    example.)
   *
   *  Given all the alternatives we go with option (4).
   *
   *  With all that said, please observe the below code in all
   *  its glory!
