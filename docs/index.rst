This is the official EdgeDB client library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It's
the easiest way to connect to your database and execute queries from a Node.js
or Deno backend.

.. _edgedb-js-installation:

**Installation**

To get started, install the ``edgedb`` module from NPM.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install edgedb      # npm users
    $ yarn add edgedb         # yarn users

There are two components of this library:

- Use the *driver* establishes a connection to your database and executes queries.
- Use the *query builder* to write queries in a code-first, typesafe way (if you wish)

The driver
==========

The driver implements the core functionality required to establish a
connection to your database and execute queries. If you prefer writing queries
as strings, the driver API is all you need.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const edgedb = require("edgedb");

  const client = edgedb.createClient();
  const query = `select "Hello world!";`;

  async function run(){
    const result = await client.query(query)
    console.log(result); // "Hello world!"
  }

  run();

If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip straight to :ref:`the Driver docs
<edgedb-js-examples>`.


.. _edgedb-js-qb:

The query builder
=================

The EdgeDB query builder provides a **code-first** way to write
**fully-typed** EdgeQL queries with TypeScript. We recommend it for TypeScript
users and JavaScript users who prefer writing queries as code.

.. code-block:: typescript

  import e from "./dbschema/edgeql-js"; // auto-generated code

  const query = e.select(e.Movie, (movie)=>({
    id: true,
    title: true,
    actors: { name: true },
    filter: e.op(movie.title, '=', 'Dune')
  }));

  const result = await query.run(client);
  // { id: string; title: string; actors: {name: string}[] }
  // property `title` is exclusive

  console.log(result.actors[0].name);
  // => Timothee Chalamet



.. note:: Is it an ORM?

  Noâ€”it's better! Like any modern TypeScript ORM, the query builder gives you
  full typesafety and autocompletion, but without the power and `performance <https://github.com/edgedb/imdbench>`_
  tradeoffs. You have access to the **full power** of EdgeQL and can write
  EdgeQL queries of arbitrary complexity. And since EdgeDB compiles each
  EdgeQL query into a single, highly-optimized SQL query, your queries stay
  fast, even when they're complex.


How do I get started?
---------------------

We recommend reading the :ref:`Driver docs <edgedb-js-examples>` first. If you
are happy writing your EdgeQL as plain strings, then that's all you need! If
you're a TypeScript user, or simply prefer writing queries in a code-first
way, continue on to the :ref:`Query builder <edgedb-js-generation>` docs.
