This is the official EdgeDB client library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It's
the easiest way to connect to your database and execute queries from a Node.js
or Deno backend.



.. _edgedb-js-installation:

**Installation**

To get started, install the ``edgedb`` module from NPM.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install edgedb      # npm users
    $ yarn add edgedb         # yarn users

There are two components of this library:

- Use the *driver* to establish a connection to your database and execute
  EdgeQL queries (written as strings).
- Use the *query builder* to write queries in a code-first, typesafe way.
  Recommended for TypeScript users.


Migration to 2.0
================

We recently released ``v0.21.0`` of the ``edgedb`` module on NPM and
``deno.land/x``, which supports the latest EdgeDB 2.0 features and protocol.
It is also backwards-compatible with v1 instances as well, so we recommend
all users upgrade.

```bash
npm install edgedb@latest
```

Breaking changes
----------------

- All ``uuid`` properties are now decoded to include hyphens. Previously
  hyphens were elided for performance reasons; this issue has since been
  resolved.

  .. code-block:: typescript

    client.querySingle(`select uuid_generate_v1mc();`);
    // "ce13b17a-7fcd-42b3-b5e3-eb28d1b953f6"


- All ``json`` properties and parameters are now parsed/stringified internally
  by the client. Previously:

  .. code-block:: typescript

    const result = await client.querySingle(
      `select to_json('{"hello": "world"}');`
    );
    result; // '{"hello": "world"}'
    typeof result; // string


  Now:

  .. code-block:: typescript

    const result = await client.querySingle(
      `select to_json('{"hello": "world"}');`
    );
    result; // {hello: "world"}
    typeof result; // object
    result.hello; // "world"


New features
------------

- Added the ``.withGlobals`` method the ``Client`` for setting :ref:`global
  variables <ref_datamodel_globals>`

  .. code-block:: typescript

    import {createClient} from "edgedb";
    const client = createClient().withGlobals({
      current_user: getUserIdFromCookie(),
    });

    client.query(`select User { email } filter .id = global current_user;`);


- Support for globals in the query builder

  .. code-block:: typescript

    const query = e.select(e.User, user => ({
      email: true,
      filter: e.op(user.id, '=', e.global.current_user)
    }));

    await query.run(client);

- Support for the ``group`` statement. :ref:`Documentation
  <ref_datamodel_globals>`

  .. code-block:: typescript

    e.group(e.Movie, movie => {
      return {
        title: true,
        actors: {name: true},
        num_actors: e.count(movie.characters),
        by: {release_year: movie.release_year},
      };
    });
    /* [
      {
        key: {release_year: 2008},
        grouping: ["release_year"],
        elements: [{
          title: "Iron Man",
          actors: [...],
          num_actors: 5
        }, {
          title: "The Incredible Hulk",
          actors: [...],
          num_actors: 3
        }]
      },
      // ...
    ] */


- Support for :ref:`range types <ref_datamodel_ranges>` and
  :eql:type:`cal::date_duration` values.


The driver
==========

The driver implements the core functionality required to establish a
connection to your database and execute queries. If you prefer writing queries
as strings, the driver API is all you need.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const edgedb = require("edgedb");

  const client = edgedb.createClient();
  const query = `select "Hello world!";`;

  async function run(){
    const result = await client.query(query)
    console.log(result); // "Hello world!"
  }

  run();

If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip straight to :ref:`the Driver docs
<edgedb-js-examples>`.


.. _edgedb-js-qb:

The query builder
=================

The EdgeDB query builder provides a **code-first** way to write
**fully-typed** EdgeQL queries with TypeScript. We recommend it for TypeScript
users and JavaScript users who prefer writing queries as code.

.. code-block:: typescript

  import e from "./dbschema/edgeql-js"; // auto-generated code

  const query = e.select(e.Movie, (movie)=>({
    id: true,
    title: true,
    actors: { name: true },
    filter: e.op(movie.title, '=', 'Dune')
  }));

  const result = await query.run(client);
  // { id: string; title: string; actors: {name: string}[] }
  // property `title` is exclusive

  console.log(result.actors[0].name);
  // => Timothee Chalamet



.. note:: Is it an ORM?

  Noâ€”it's better! Like any modern TypeScript ORM, the query builder gives you
  full typesafety and autocompletion, but without the power and `performance
  <https://github.com/edgedb/imdbench>`_
  tradeoffs. You have access to the **full power** of EdgeQL and can write
  EdgeQL queries of arbitrary complexity. And since EdgeDB compiles each
  EdgeQL query into a single, highly-optimized SQL query, your queries stay
  fast, even when they're complex.


How do I get started?
---------------------

We recommend reading the :ref:`Driver docs <edgedb-js-examples>` first. If you
are happy writing your EdgeQL as plain strings, then that's all you need! If
you're a TypeScript user, or simply prefer writing queries in a code-first
way, continue on to the :ref:`Query builder <edgedb-js-generation>` docs.
