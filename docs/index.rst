This is the official EdgeDB client library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It's
the easiest way to connect to your database and execute queries from a Node.js
or Deno backend.

.. note::

  We recently released ``v0.21.0`` of the ``edgedb`` module on NPM and
  ``deno.land/x``, which supports the latest EdgeDB 2.0 features and protocol.
  It is also backwards-compatible with v1 instances as well, so we recommend
  all users upgrade. Read the `release notes
  <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/releases/tag/v0.21.0>`_ for details.

There are two components of this library:

- Use the :ref:`Driver API <edgedb-js-intro-driver>` to establish a connection
  to your database and execute EdgeQL queries (written as strings).
- Use the :ref:`Query Builder API <edgedb-js-intro-qb>` to write queries in a
  code-first, typesafe way. Recommended for TypeScript users.


.. _edgedb-js-installation:

**Requirements**

*Node.js users*

- [Node only] Node.js 14+. Run ``node --version`` to see your current version
- [Deno only] Deno v1.17+. Run ``deno --version`` to see your current version
- [TypeScript only] Node.js type declarations: ``npm install @types/node``
- [TypeScript only] ``"strict": true`` in ``tsconfig.json`` ``compilerOptions``

**Installation**

*Node users*: Install the ``edgedb`` module from NPM.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install edgedb      # npm users
    $ yarn add edgedb         # yarn users

Deno users: Import from ``deno.land/x/edgedb``:

.. code-block::

  import * as edgedb from "https://deno.land/x/edgedb/mod.ts"

.. _edgedb-js-intro-driver:

The driver
==========

The driver implements the core functionality required to establish a
connection to your database and execute queries. If you prefer writing queries
as strings, the driver API is all you need.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const edgedb = require("edgedb");

  const client = edgedb.createClient();
  const query = `select "Hello world!";`;

  async function run(){
    const result = await client.query(query)
    console.log(result); // "Hello world!"
  }

  run();

If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip straight to :ref:`the Driver docs
<edgedb-js-driver>`.


.. _edgedb-js-intro-qb:

The query builder
=================

The EdgeDB query builder provides a **code-first** way to write
**fully-typed** EdgeQL queries with TypeScript. We recommend it for TypeScript
users and JavaScript users who prefer writing queries as code.

.. code-block:: typescript

  import e from "./dbschema/edgeql-js"; // auto-generated code

  const query = e.select(e.Movie, (movie)=>({
    id: true,
    title: true,
    actors: { name: true },
    filter: e.op(movie.title, '=', 'Dune')
  }));

  const result = await query.run(client);
  // { id: string; title: string; actors: {name: string}[] }
  // property `title` is exclusive

  console.log(result.actors[0].name);
  // => Timothee Chalamet



.. note:: Is it an ORM?

  Noâ€”it's better! Like any modern TypeScript ORM, the query builder gives you
  full typesafety and autocompletion, but without the power and `performance
  <https://github.com/edgedb/imdbench>`_
  tradeoffs. You have access to the **full power** of EdgeQL and can write
  EdgeQL queries of arbitrary complexity. And since EdgeDB compiles each
  EdgeQL query into a single, highly-optimized SQL query, your queries stay
  fast, even when they're complex.


How do I get started?
---------------------

We recommend reading the :ref:`Driver docs <edgedb-js-driver>` first. If you
are happy writing your EdgeQL as plain strings, then that's all you need! If
you're a TypeScript user, or simply prefer writing queries in a code-first
way, continue on to the :ref:`Query builder <edgedb-js-generation>` docs.
