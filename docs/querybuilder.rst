=============
Query Builder
=============

The EdgeDB query builder provides a **code-first** way to write
**fully-typed** EdgeQL queries with TypeScript. We recommend it for TypeScript
users, or anyone who prefers writing queries with code.

.. code-block:: typescript

  const query = e.select(e.Movie, ()=>({
    id: true,
    title: true,
    actors: { name: true }
  }));

  const result = await query.run(client)
  // { id: string; title: string; actors: {name: string}[] }[]

Why use the query builder?
--------------------------

*Type inference!* If you're using TypeScript, the result type of *all
queries* is automatically inferred for you. For the first time, you don't
need an ORM to write strongly typed queries.

*Auto-completion!* You can write queries full autocompletion on EdgeQL
keywords, standard library functions, and link/property names.

*Type checking!* In the vast majority of cases, the query builder won't let
you construct invalid queries. This eliminates an entire class of bugs and
helps you write valid queries the first time.
